This document contains instructions for preparing a DMS dissertation, and is, itself, is a properly formatted demonstration of a dissertation. This is packaged as a set of files. You put different things in different files. We'll tell you what goes in where. The goal is have all the formatting taken care of and allow you to concentrate on writing a great dissertation. Still, based on your own judgment and the watchful eye of the GSO, you are likely to make changes. We encourage you to contribute changes and make pull requests on GitHub, in order that future students may benefit from your experience.
