% Please maintain the prescribed order of acknowledgements from the GSO.
% First thank the advisor
Many thanks to my advisor Prof.\ Larry Bird, for teaching me the secret to a perfect jump shot.

% Then thank the committee
My committee members, Profs.\ David Crosby, Stephen Stills, and Graham Nash were very generous with their time.  And special thanks to my external committee member Neil Young for making the trip from Manitoba.

% Then acknowledge financial support
\noindent
I gratefully acknowledge support from the National Pen Foundation, under grant \#2022-18734 which provided me with five years of ballpoint pens.

% Then thank for technical support
Whenever my coffee machine broke, the NJIT department of caffeine services came quickly and repaired the system before I began to show signs of withdrawal. Java Joe was especially helpful---and friendly!

% Finally friends and family
I would like to thank my classmates and predecessors in the NJIT DMS, especially Adrienne James for creating such an excellent \LaTeX\ style file.  It
does a great job of laying out my dissertation, so I can spend more time on
improving the content.
