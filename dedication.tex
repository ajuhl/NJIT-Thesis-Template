{\em Unlike chess and its different pieces and complicated rules, Go is
played with black and white stones equal in value, seemingly making it
compatible with the binary nature of computers. Since the aim of a move is to
control the most territory, the optimal move yields the maximum amount of
territory---a simple counting procedure and a chore computers excel at. Yet
in spite of the efforts of the world's best programmers over the last 30
years, the level of computer Go remains about that of a human who has studied
Go for a month.}
