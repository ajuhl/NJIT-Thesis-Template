# The new DMS Thesis Template

***WARNING:*** This should be considered beta software. I am still waiting for approval from the GSO to the changes I made here.

In 2001, DMS doctoral student Adrienne James wrote a template file for dissertations in the NJIT Department of Mathematical Sciences. This document has circulated among students, who have made occasional additions and modifications. Many students, I am sure have made their own modifications but have not contributed them back to the circulating document.

In September, 2022, Prof. Roy Goodman, Associate Chair for Graduate Studies asked his former Ph.D. student Jimmie Adriazola to help him update this document. He then asked Prof. Christina Frederick to help with some of the more technical $\LaTeX$ details in the class file.

We have made a lot of changes that should make it easier for students who are somewhat novices at using $\LaTeX$ to produce a beautiful dissertation that complies with the formatting requirements of the GSO without too much fiddling around.

Some highlights:

* Greatly improved structure of document and folders, with different parts separated in a logical way.
* The "Publications and Presentations" listing in the **Biography** section is now entered using Bib$\TeX$, in the same file as the main bibliography, so it is formatted automatically.
* The sample file has been completely rewritten to explain all the parts of the document, all the sub-files, and some of the formatting rules. Examples of all optional parts, such as the List of Symbols, are now included in the document.
* The numbering of the appendices now conforms to GSO rules. There are two options, depending on whether the dissertation has one appendix or multiple appendices.
* Because the document is now on GitHub, students who modify the template are encouraged to make pull requests so that future students may benefit from their work.
