\preface

This is a preface. It is optional and must come just before any chapters.

This sample thesis contains two chapters. The first describes the structure of the document and, in particular, all the files that need to be modified to complete the dissertation. This second gives some guidelines for formatting figures, tables, and the bibliography.
